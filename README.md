From your comments in the uploaded document: reading into the vector was never an option to consider; the vector contained pointers to dynamic instances;   
you couldn't write/read addresses of dynamic data. See the assignment sheet: the only thing that would work is to store *data* in the file   
read that data back in, and use that data to call addShapes and pass it the data that was just read from the file. That requires a loop (just like we have   
always used a loop to read data from a file...does that make sense?
